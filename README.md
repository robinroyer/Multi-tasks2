# Multi-tasks2
Multi-tasks C program that takes an input file composed of random numbers and for each line, displays its prime factors.
The program uses memoization: the results of previous factorisation are stored and re-used for upcoming ones

###Make targets:

```
	  number2:  generate an imput file: number2.txt
	  generator: compile the generator.c
	  solution1: compile your program without Memoization
	  solution2: compile your program without Memoization
	  run1 run2:  run your program through the 'time' utility
	  clean:  delete all generated files
```

### Improvement

- Many improvements should be done:
- [ ] Using a better algorithm (the one in wikipedia is quite good)
- [ ] Using a script that runs the program on several computers(cf 2014-2015)
- [ ] Used a real memoization system
