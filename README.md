# Multi-tasks2
Multi-tasks C program that takes an input files composed by random number and for each lines, displays its prime factors.
The program uses memoization: the results of previous factorisation are stored and re-used for upcoming ones

###Make targets:

```
	  number2:  generate an imput files: number2.txt
	  generator: compile the generator.c
	  solution1: compile your programs without Memoization
	  solution2: compile your programs without Memoization
	  run1 run2:  run your programs through the 'time' utility
	  clean:  delete all generated files
```

### Improvements

- Many improvements should be done:
- [ ] Using a better algorithm (the one in wikipedia is quite good)
- [ ] Using a script that runs the program multi-computer multi-thread (cf 2014-2015)
- [ ] Used a real memoization system
